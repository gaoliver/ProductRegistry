# App Registry

This app was made only for studying. While my fianc√© is trainning her UX skiils on this project, I'm using it as the front end for my api-vendas back end studying repo.

<br>

## How to run

For running this project, just download both this and api-vendas repos, run api-vendas on terminal, as explained on its README file, and - for runnig this app - open the terminal on project's folder and run:

```Shell
yarn && yarn start
```

It's going to be started an expo project. So you can run this on your device, by scanning the QR Code on Expo Go app.
